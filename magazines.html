            <h1>Product Information</h1>
<!--             <div class="product-info">
                <p>Yahoo Tech was only the beginning of an entire suite of category-specific verticals. I was one of the lead product and interaction designers for the foundation of Yahoo Tech, Food, Beauty, and more. Yahoo Tech was the first to launch within the family. I was given the opportunity to work closely with David Pogue and Megan Liberman to design a Tech vertical "magazine" for our editors. The goal of these "magazines" was to get users to engage in a category they liked. Designing a visual representation of news articles really appealed to our users because they like big imagery instead of a stream of headlines. But what is more, the main difference our "magazines" family had compared to other news reporting websites was that everything was purely editorial and were written by people who really cared about these topics.</p>
                <p>I designed and defined many foundational interactive components and user experiences that had to be scalable across the entire family of magazines. Some of these elements included photo carousels, sharing capabilities, navigational structure, and most importantly, the grid that would need to work for every vertical on every device. I had also designed the publishing tool that editors used to publish content, images, manage navigation items, and the capability to schedule posts to publish automatically at specific times. These magazines were built from the ground up and many of these features had to be defined and completely designed from scratch.</p>
