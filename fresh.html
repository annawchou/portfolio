            <h1>Product Information</h1>
            <div class="product-info">
                <p>My team and I wanted to create and design an entire end-to-end experience around a community that currently exists in our world; food lovers. The problem we were solving was the fact that it was difficult for people in the food community to buy and sell their own personal food products in a safe way. Our product first connected the people in the community on a platform where people can begin to earn trust as well as create an identity that people trusted.</p><p>We designed an entire flow of how a user sets up an account, profile, and the ability to purchase goods. We also expanded the product to include recipes and the ability to view, save, and add the ingredients of the recipe to a shopping cart. We then also added a third component to our product called 'Community' where people can reach out to eachother and chat, share, and discuss about food and recipes. We felt that 'Community' was the most important component to piece the recipe and marketplaces together. This was how users understood where they would purchase their goods. Sellers would have to create good reputation in order to make business through the community.</p>
            </div>
            <h1>Architecture</h1>
            <p>This was our final sitemap that defined our product. We broke down our product into Marketplace, Recipes, and Community. We had also included other important interation functions such as search, advanced search, grocery list, shopping cart, and user profile. This was used for both web and native.</p>

            <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
            <p>My team and I conducted several competitive analyses. We looked at websites such as Etsy, Vegetarian Times, Fab, and Joyus to see what worked and didn't work.</p>
