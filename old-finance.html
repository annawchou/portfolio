            <h1>Solving for a large usability struggle</h1>
            <p>After weeks of research, we realized the biggest struggle of all was our navigation structure.</p>

            <h1>Mobile design explorations</h1>
            <p>Coming up with different solutions for mobile was tough because of trying to fit a lot of utility in a small real estate. <br />Users wanted everything and we don't blame them. </p>

            <h1>A/B Bucket testing</h1>
            <p><strong class="problem">Problem:</strong> In the meantime we needed to figure out a short-term solution for users to discover how to create new lists and accessing them. <br /><strong class="solution">Short-term solution</strong> We did multiple dropdown designs and chose the one that performed the best in parallel to the new effort.
            <img class="responsive-image space" src="./images/taj-mahal/bucket-test.png"/>

            <h1>User Research &#38; Iterating</h1>
            <p><strong class="problem">Problem:</strong> Since we added the ability to create multiple lists, users had a lot of trouble figuring out how to do that.<br /><strong class="solution">Solution:</strong> We redesigned the navigation to optimize for more than one list to encourage users to create more lists.</p>
            <video playsinline class="responsive-image" width="100%" autoplay loop src="./images/taj-mahal/study2.mp4" muted></video>
            <p><strong class="feature">Feature Request:</strong> Users wanted some visual indication so they could differentiate between created, linked, and followed lists<br /><strong class="feature">A/B Test:</strong> We ran an a/b/c test and learned that most people liked the left two choices.</p>
            <img class="responsive-image" src="./images/taj-mahal/study3.png"/>
            <p><strong class="problem">Problem:</strong> When we tested the new list and performance views, users felt that the performance tab was redundant and didn't like having to tap betwen them.<br /><strong class="solution">Solution:</strong> We simplified the performance information into a card instead and added total value for individual portfolios to help differentiate lists.</p>
            <video playsinline class="responsive-image" width="100%" autoplay loop src="./images/taj-mahal/study4.mp4" muted></video>
            <p><strong class="problem">Problem:</strong> After moving to the list of lists, users complained about having to tap to view their watchlist now.<br /><strong class="solution">Solution:</strong> Because the new navigation tested well, we added an accordion so that users could open multiple lists at once and leave them open but still allowing them to tap into individual lists.</p>

            <p><strong class="feature">Feature Request:</strong> Users wanted the ability to compare their total performance value to overall market value.<br /><strong class="solution">Solution:</strong> We added an option in the overflow to enable performance chart for those who were more advanced.</p>

            <p><strong class="feature">Feature Request:</strong> After adding the performance chart, users wanted an additional ability to be able to select which lists get added to the total value.<br /><strong class="solution">Solution:</strong> We added another option in the overflow to allow users to toggle on and off which lists they wanted.</p>

            <p><strong class="problem">Problem:</strong> We originally tried to stay consistent with mobile but users felt the accordion was wasting space.<br /><strong class="solution">Solution:</strong> We did a split view that was more dense but didn't lack any of the utility that users needed.</p>
