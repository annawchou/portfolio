However, the experience only allowed users to have one watchlist. Research showed that users can have over 100 symbols in their watchlist.</p>

                    <h1>Designing for scale</h1>
                    <p>Once we ended up with the list of lists, I also had to consider scaling this for iPad users, as a lot of Yahoo Finance users commonly use iPad as well. I explored using similiar list of lists concept for the phone to the iPad and also considered completely redesigning the experience differently to utilize the real estate more.</p>

                    <h2>Let's build a custom UI for the iPad</h2>
                    <p>I went back to the drawing board to see if I could better utilize the space specifically for iPad users. I took inspiration from the iMessage Apple app and applied that principle to this new design direction. iPad users are already familiar with the left side navigation, why not use this to enable users to easily navigate between their lists?</p>
