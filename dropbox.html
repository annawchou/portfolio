                    <p>After learning about the tools users commonly use for e-signature, we wondered what a typical workflow looked like. Because today, users aren't able to bring files from Dropbox directly into any cloud tool such as DocuSign.com like they would when opening a file to a desktop app. So we set our product goal to design a way to surface cloud tools on the Dropbox platform to allow users to kick-off their workflows starting from their file to mimic the capability users can do when opening in desktop apps.</p>

                    <p>Before we could understand what the design should be solving for, we had to first understand the user's full end-to-end journey to inform the experience we design for them. We interviewed over 30 users and identified common themes and pain points that were being surfaced throughout different workflows when users use Dropbox and cloud tools. And one of the biggest questions and risk we wanted to validate was whether the user initiated their workflow from the file first or the tool first.</p>
